			<p class="see-para">"The law" has been enforced to engender fear to those going in the wrong, and thereby rewarding a heavy penalty to the victors for their clandestine mis-doings. The irony in India lies in the fact that fear lingers amongst the victims, awaiting the attack of the sadists, the rapists.</p>
			<p class="see-para">The early morning sun shines its luminous light onto my closed eyes, as I shrink my eyes to the sudden bright beam. I turn over and crawl to reach my phone. The clock on my phone reads 6.55am. Shoot! "Have to get ready" I mourn. As I indulge and gobble up my morning breakfast, my eyes hover over the newspaper lying on the dining table. As the fan flutters the front page, I read along the headlines 'Verdict in Delhi Gang Rape Case today'. I heave a deep sigh. The clock on the wall reads 7.35, "Hurry hurry hurry" my mind repeats. Do I ask Dad to drop me at my bus stop, or do I run for it? I go for the latter. Waving a frantic bye to Dad, I start off with a brisk jog, looking at my watch now and then.</p>
			<p class="see-para">As I walk, I feel someone looking at me. I look to my right. A man stands, staring stealthily and running his eyes from top to bottom. I give him a disgusted look and move faster ahead. I reach the main road and wait for the vehicles to cross by as I need to go to the other side of the road. I cross halfway and wait for the other side vehicles to clear up. Quite suddenly, a truck zooms so close. I hear the truck driver screaming "Want to come home?". I stare in disbelief. My office shuttle arrives and I seat myself only for the words 'Want to come home?' rewinding and playing in my head. I plug my headphones in my ears, grit my teeth, and shut my eyes to 'let it go'.</p>
			<p class="see-para">I reach office safe and start working, a great distraction from my experience this morning, I strongly felt. My watch reads 11 and I walk to the pantry to get a nice steaming cup of tea. And so, my discussion with my colleagues begins at office.</p>
			<p class="see-para">"Dude, I had a crazy night partying yesterday! And the night was crazy only because of one dumb girl!" taunts my friend.</p>
			<p class="see-para">"What?" I say in pure disgust.</p>
			<p class="see-para">"Yeah dude. I'm sorry to say, but this is exactly why I feel girls get raped!"</p>
			<p class="see-para">"What??" I repeat, even more disgusted.</p>
			<p class="see-para">"Yeah. She was quite drunk and she was asking everyone at the night club to give her a lift."</p>
			<p class="see-para">"So? What does that got to do with girls getting raped?"</p>
			<p class="see-para">"No. I'm just saying this could be one of the many possible reasons for girls getting raped."</p>
			<p class="see-para">I just grit my teeth and walk away to my desk, to distract myself again. Women behave in a certain way, so they could get raped! Wow! Women should stay like statues, and even then they'd get raped... I wanted to scream! How can anyone give a reason to why women are being raped, apart from the fact that the rapists are purely horrifying, indecent, uncouth maniacs!</p>
			<p class="see-para">My phone rings and my dad calls. "Are you coming back home early?”, he asks. "No dad, I'm taking the 7.45 shuttle back home, I'll reach home only by 9.”, I reply.</p>
			<p class="see-para">"Alright, let me know when you reach your stop, I'll come to pick you up", he says. "Sure dad", I say and hang up.</p>
			<p class="see-para">As I take my shuttle back home, the day's events run in my head. I realise I've a certain amount of fear hitting me all the time, of what men could do if I walk alone on an empty street. The karate ought to me keep me safe. But why can't I learn karate because I want to learn karate, and not because my anxiety is taking a toll on me? The pepper spray, I got to keep it to spray the pepper particles into the rapists' eyes. What if I'm caught unawares? Then how can I use my weapon and protect myself? Protecting myself, that seems to be the only sensible solution for now, or is it? Oh god, I just want to get back home, I only want to get back home.</p>
			<p class="see-para">My shuttle stops and I get down. My dad waves and smiles. I hold his hand and we walk back home. I feel safe, daddy, I'm coming home.</p>
